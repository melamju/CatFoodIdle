# Cat Food Idle Game

----- Computer Graphics 2D Project -----

Cat Food Idle is a Cookie-Clicker-like game, where you click on the food box to gain more food and buy upgrades.
The more food you have, the more cats are visiting and praising your food bowl.  
You can upgrade:  
* the amount of food dropping
* the value of the food
* an automatic clicker

You can see if an upgrade is available, when the color of the button-border is changing from red to orange.  
The auto clicker is visible through a cat foot print appearing on the food box, but it is not dropping any food.

All images were drawn by myself, using Clip Studio Paint. (https://www.clipstudio.net)

This programm is using the learnOpenGL.com 2D game template from "Setting up" up to "Collisions - Collision Detection" (https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Setting-up) - (https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Collisions/Collision-detection)  

My additions to the learnOpenGL tutorial are all the special objects, which inherit from the GameObject class and most of the functionality in the game.cpp methods.  

Other sources of small code snippets are mentioned in the comments before the respective code.

The project directory "application-zip" contains a zip-file with the Cat Food Idle game executable to run without building the project.
